**`CS Student @ Penn State, Entrepreneur, Tech Enthusiast`**

Hello, world! I'm Aravind, and I am currently a junior at Penn State Univeristy pursuing a computer science major and a physics minor. I have been fortunate enough to have explored multiple areas in the field of computer science and have developed projects in 

- 📱 Web and app development
- 💻 Full stack applications
- 🤖 Machine learning
- 💡 Arduino/Raspberry Pi programming
- ⚙️ API development, and more.

All of my projects are built from an idea, inspired by the opportunity to solve a real-world problem. These projects reflect my purpose of applying the skills that I learn to help and better those around me.
